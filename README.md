# N-Queens with Regions Solver using Python and tkinter

This project provides a graphical interface to solve the N-Queens problem with additional region constraints using Python's tkinter library. The user can input a board configuration where each cell represents a region, and the solver algorithm ensures that queens are placed such that no two queens threaten each other in the same row, column, or diagonal, respecting region constraints.

## Features:

Interactive GUI for board input and visualization.
Customizable board size and region colors.
Solution display without altering original board colors.
Clear interface for selecting colors and managing board configurations.

## How to Use:

Enter the board size (N) and color regions using the intuitive GUI.
Click squares to assign colors based on region selection.
Submit to solve the N-Queens problem respecting region constraints.
View solutions directly on the board grid with 'Q' marks.

## Technologies Used:
